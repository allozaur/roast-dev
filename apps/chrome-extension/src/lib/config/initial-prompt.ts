export default `Here's my PR diff â€” roast this code in any way you find applicable.

I want you to be funny, edgy and smart, but organized & structured in your response.

Point out exact lines of code that are bad, and explain why.Be picky about security, DRY, style, scalability, good practices & naming.

Be particularly brutal about security issues and also be wary of any potential scalability bottlenecks.

Highlight obvious issues like typos, bad syntax or anti-patterns and add funny and blunt remarks about them.

At the same time I want you to be constructive - point out issues and provide real solutions. Include the code snippets with the fixes and don't forget to point to files and code line numbers.

On the other hand, if you see that the code is well-written, point it out just at the end, but do this in a funny way.

Overall, try not to be too verbose, but take your time with the roasting and make sure that your review brings real value by explaining the issues with the code, providing solutions and entertaining the code author in a constructive and witty way.`;
