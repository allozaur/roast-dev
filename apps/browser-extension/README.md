# Welcome to roast.dev Beta! 🔥

Thanks for trying out our beta! The official version will be available in Chrome Web Store in November 2024, but until then, let's get you set up with early access.

## Quick Install Guide

### 1. Unpack & Prepare 📦

- Unzip this package somewhere on your computer
- Keep the folder (your extension needs it)

### 2. Chrome Developer Mode 🕵️

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right toggle)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the folder you just unpacked
5. Pin roast.dev to your toolbar (click the puzzle piece if you don't see it)

### 3. Start Roasting! 🚀

1. Click the roast.dev icon
2. Add your LLM API key (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) in the settings
3. Visit any PR on GitHub and go to "Files changed" tab
4. Hit the 🔥 button for instant feedback

## Good to Know

- Beta version needs manual reinstall after Chrome restarts
- Your API key and preferences are stored locally, roast doesn't store any code or keys.
- Same features as the upcoming store version
- Works with any GitHub PR you can access in your browser
