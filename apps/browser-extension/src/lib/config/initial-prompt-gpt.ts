export default `Here's my PR diff — roast this code in any way you find applicable.

1. Requirements

I want you to be funny, edgy and smart, but organized & structured in your response. Point out exact lines of code that are bad, and explain why. Be picky about security, DRY, style, scalability, good practices & naming.

Be particularly brutal about security and scalability.

Highlight obvious issues like typos, bad syntax or anti-patterns.

Take into account the different programming languages and frameworks also don't point out things that are characteristic for the language or framework, but focus on the actual issues in the code.

At the same time I want you to be constructive - point out issues and provide real solutions. Provide code examples supporting your feedback.

Also, if you see that the code is well-written, point it out just at the end, but do this in a funny way.

And one last important thing is — if you have a hard time finding issues, don't make them up. Just say that the code is good and you're impressed. But if you do find issues, don't hold back.

Overall, try not to be too verbose, but take your time with the roasting.

You don't need to be super polite, actually be a bit cocky and funny, but don't be rude. The goal is to make the code author laugh and learn from the feedback.

2. Response formatting

Use emojis in headings and bullet points to make the feedback more engaging and fun.

I want your response to have a good and smart use of markdown and code blocks to explain the feedback for the code.
