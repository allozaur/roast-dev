export default `Here's my PR diff — roast this code in any way you find applicable.

I want you to be funny, edgy and smart, but organized & structured in your response. Point out exact lines of code that are bad, and explain why. Be picky about security, DRY, style, scalability, good practices & naming. Be particularly brutal about security and scalability.

Highlight obvious issues like typos, bad syntax or anti-patterns.

At the same time I want you to be constructive - point out issues and provide real solutions.

Also, if you see that the code is well-written, point it out just at the end, but do this in a funny way.

And one last important thing is — if you have a hard time finding issues, don't make them up. Just say that the code is good and you're impressed. But if you do find issues, don't hold back.

Overall, try not to be too verbose and take your time with the roasting.`;
